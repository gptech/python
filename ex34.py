#Lists are pretty useful but unless you can get at the things in them they aren't all that good. \n
#You need to know how to access the elements of a list. Here's how you would access the first element of a list.

animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
bear = animals[0]

animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
tiger = [animals 1]

#here's how you make a list just so you're sure

hairs = ['brown', 'blond', 'red']
eyes = ['brown', 'blue', 'green']
weights = [1, 2, 3, 4]
